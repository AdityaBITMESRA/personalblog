<p>Welcome to my new blog! This is the second post, and I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences about Google Summer Of Code.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-this-blog-about">
<h3>What is this blog about?</h3>
<p>This blog will cover my initial experience about Gooogle Summer Of Code with INCF(Organisation).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-experience">
<h3>My Experience?</h3>
<p>In my initial phase of learning the basics of Machine Learning. A senior advised me to watch the
lectures of Geoffrey Hinton on Neural Networks, I watched the first few lectures and understood
how the neural networks are designed taking in reference to our brain. I was determined to know
more about it and found out about the NeuroML Project. I started to contribute to the NeuroML project
by raising a PR, During this Phase my mentor Ankur Sinha Sir helped me immensely with huge patience
Finally, I got selected inot Google Summer of Code (GSoC), I was thrilled.</p>
<p>My GSoC project involves developing an interactive SWC to NeuroML converter in Python.
The SWC format is widely used for representing neuronal morphology data, while NeuroML
is a standardized format for describing biophysically detailed neuronal models.</p>
<p>The converter I'll be working on will simplify the process of converting SWC data into the NeuroML format,
making it easier for researchers to integrate morphological data into their computational models.
One of the key components of my project is the development of an interactive tool that will allow users to
visualize and manipulate the neuronal morphology data before converting it to NeuroML. This tool will provide
researchers with a more hands-on approach to working with their data, enabling them to make adjustments and
explore different scenarios before finalizing their models.
To ensure the robustness and accuracy of the converter, I will be testing it against a range of neuronal
reconstructions from the NeuroMorpho.org database. This extensive testing will help identify and address
any potential issues or edge cases, ultimately leading to a more reliable and efficient conversion process.
I am thrilled to have the opportunity to contribute to the NeuroML community and the broader field of computational
neuroscience. With my knowledge of Python, SWC, NeuroML, and some background in computational neuroscience,
I am confident in my ability to take on this challenging project.
The project will be hosted on the NeuroML GitHub page, ensuring transparency and collaboration within the
open-source community. I am deeply grateful to Google for providing this incredible opportunity through the
GSoC program and to my mentors, Ankur Sinha and Padraig Gleeson, for their guidance and support.</p>

<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>In the coming posts, I plan to post about the technical challenges I will be facing while making through GSoC</p>
<p>I'll also share updates on any personal projects I'm working on and the lessons I learn along the way.</p>

<dt>Thank you for joining me on this adventure! I'm looking forward to sharing my thoughts and experiences with you.</dt>
<dd>Feel free to leave comments, suggestions, or just say hello.</dd>
